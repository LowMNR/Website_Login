            <h1>Essay about Technology</h1>
            <p>
                Technology nowadays has become very important in our daily life, it is like a shortcut to everything.
                You can book a trip right from your phone, you can buy items that will come straight to your house from sites like Amazon, and you can even cheat during an exam haha just kidding!
                With technology everything becomes easy, you can learn new things and talk to family members who live far from you;
                Technology is also used in the medical field to discover new treatments, create medicines and much more.
                As we can see, technology has many pros but it also has many cons, if used incorrectly it can become an addiction, it can makes you become lazy, it can cause stress, young kids can get cyberbullied or even catfished by adults.
                In general Technology is a good way to learn new things or for saving your time on booking a hotel or a trip, like everything else Technology is useful in moderation, you shouldn’t spend a lot of time staying on the internet, you can hang out with friends or do some sport, read a book, get a job or anything else that isn’t technology.
